Using Ansible Vault

## Create the playbook with varaible files which contain user and password hash >> user_with_passwd.yml

## create varaible file with ansible-vault create secret.yml, with all vairables you want.

for password hash I used this python library 

python -c 'import crypt; print crypt.crypt("password", "$1$SomeSalt$")'

## create a vault file to store password for secret.yml, so you won't get a prompt to enter your password

## run ansible-playbook and watch it
